# BeyondJenBot

## Introduction

This is a Twitch Bot I made for [beyondtheed](https://www.twitch.tv/beyondtheed). She is a Splatoon 2
Salmon Run streamer, and we needed a bot mostly to keep track of viewers who want to play games with
her and the number of games remaining before we rotate out new viewers. I will update the bot as the
need for more commands show up, but currently, we have 5 main functions for the bot: Fun Counter,
Yawn Counter, Queue, Game Counter, and Special Counter.  

## Installation

Anybody is free to clone and use the bot, but all the functions made on this bot is specialized and mostly
likely will be of little use to you. If you still want to use it though, here are the steps below:  

1. Follow the instructions on running the bot locally [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc).
2. Change the username and password on the beyondtheed.js file to your Twitch Bot username and oauth password.
3. Make other changes in the code as needed.
4. Run with `node beyondtheed.js`  

## Updates

January 16, 2021 Update
1.) All yawn commands can be substititued with 'juan'.
2.) Special commands added.
